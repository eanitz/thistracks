  <h3>Understanding First Aid</h3>

  <p>First aid is the immediate help given to someone who is sick or injured. It's a set of life-saving skills that empowers you to provide care for minor injuries and illnesses until professional medical assistance arrives.</p>

  <h3>Basic First Aid Kits</h3>

  <p>Every prepper should have a well-stocked first aid kit. It should include items like adhesive bandages, gauze pads, medical tape, antiseptic wipes, tweezers, and over-the-counter pain relievers. For homesteaders, consider adding supplies for larger wounds or farm-specific accidents.</p>

  <h3>Key First Aid Skills</h3>

    <li><strong>Stopping Bleeding:</strong> Press firmly on the wound with a clean cloth to slow down bleeding. If necessary, apply a bandage or dressing.</li>
    <li><strong>Wound Cleaning:</strong> Clean wounds gently with warm water and soap to prevent infection. Use antiseptic wipes for smaller cuts.</li>
    <li><strong>Bandaging:</strong> Apply a clean, sterile bandage over the wound. Secure it with medical tape or an elastic bandage, making sure it's not too tight.</li>
    <li><strong>Splinting:</strong> Use a makeshift splint to immobilize broken bones or sprains. Materials can include sticks, clothes, or even rolled magazines.</li>
    <li><strong>CPR and Choking:</strong> Knowing CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) and the Heimlich maneuver for choking victims could save lives in emergencies.</li>
